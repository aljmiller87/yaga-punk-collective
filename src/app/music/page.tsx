            You enclose the commons, you put up the fence. <br />
            To survive- have to use it, gotta pay rent
            <br />
            But you mix no labor, you don&apos;t occupy,
            <br />
            If I wanna live, gotta sell my time
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Absentee ownership, what a fucking farce
            <br />
            Just making life artificially scarce
            <br />
            Burn the leasing office, tear it apart
            <br />
            No more landlords, that&apos;d be a start

            It&apos;s the sickest goddamn joke I&apos;ve ever fucking known,

            A magic deed and title that says you own,
            <br />
            Basically feudalism, has a nasty ring
