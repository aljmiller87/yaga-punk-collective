            NoZen is a newly forming hardcore punk band. They recently released
            this track without lyrics or vocals. As an experiment, I wrote and
            recorded my own vocals for their original song. I have their
            permission to post my version. You should absolutely check them out!

          <p>
            None of my friends will ever be homeless <br />
            Not while I can still fucking breathe <br />
            We&apos;ll build each other up, we&apos;ll survive and thrive <br />
            Together, a family, we&apos;ll fight this fight
          </p>
          <p>
            It must be hard living in a world <br />
            Where you have such little control over it all <br />
            I&apos;m here to tell you something I think is true <br />
            Together we can build, build something new
          </p>
          <p>
            They say we&apos;re ungrateful, they say we&apos;re a waste <br />
            But they don&apos;t know the struggle, they don&apos;t know the
            taste <br />
            Of living on the edge with nowhere to go <br />
            But we&apos;ll write our own story, we&apos;ll take control
          </p>
          <p>
            It must be hard living in a world <br />
            Where you have such little control over it all <br />
            I&apos;m here to tell you something I think is true <br />
            Together we can build, build something new
          </p>
          <p>
            You&apos;re not just a statistic, You&apos;re a person I adore
            <br />I won&apos;t let you fall through cracks in society&apos;s
            floor <br />
            They try to tear us down, make us feel small <br />
            But when I&apos;m here with youk, I feel so fucking tall
          </p>
          <p>
            It must be hard living in a world <br />
            Where you have such little control over it all <br />
            I&apos;m here to tell you something I think is true <br />
            Together we can build, build something new
          </p>
          <p>
            None of my friends will ever be homeless <br />
            Not while I can live, not while I can give!
