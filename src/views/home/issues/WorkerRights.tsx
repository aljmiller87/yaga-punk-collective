        ensure South Lexington wins economic development projects that will
        ensure our middle class can thrive, or working with our union teachers
        and school board to ensure that they have the resources they need to
        give our kids a world-class educationâ€”I will <b>always</b> stand with
        working people fighting for a fair shake.
