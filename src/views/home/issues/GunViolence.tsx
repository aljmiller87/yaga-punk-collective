      <p>
        Gun violence is a public health crisis and it should be treated as such.
        The best way we can address this public health crisis at the Council
        level is to address its underlying causes: poverty, lack of mental
        health care, and lack of access to economic opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree with Devine Carama, the Director of One Lexington, when he said
        that “true prosperity will never be reached until we transition from
        continuum of care/services to a continuum of opportunity.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I will work to ensure that we make that transition by engaging community
        partners to remove barriers and create economic opportunities for our
        young people, offer trauma support to all who are directly impacted, and
        provide the resources that our communities need to break the cycle of
        gun violence.
