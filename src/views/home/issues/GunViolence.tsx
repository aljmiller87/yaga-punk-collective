      <p>
        Gun violence is a public health crisis and it should be treated as such.
        The best way to end gun violence is to address its underlying causes:
        poverty, broken families, and lack of access to opportunity. Our
        Council&apos;s partnership with ONE Lexington has changed—and saved—the
        lives of countless Lexingtonians. We must continue to invest in programs
        that lift our people up and stop the cycle of violence.
