      <p>
        Renters and homeowners alike deserve homes they can thrive in at prices
        they can afford. That&apos;s why I fought hard to ensure our Council
        passed a ban on source-of-income discrimination and why I support a
        complete and thorough overhaul of our zoning ordinances and land-use
        guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your councilmember, I will advocate for policies that prioritize
        Lexingtonians, not predatory out-of-state corporations or
        special-interest groups.
