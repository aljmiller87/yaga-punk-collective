        Renters and homeowners alike deserve homes they can thrive in at prices
        they can afford.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&apos;s why I fought hard to ensure our Council passed a ban on
        source-of-income discrimination and why I will always advocate for
        policies that prioritize Lexingtonians, not predatory out-of-state
        corporations or special-interest groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your councilmember, I will push to create more emergency housing for
        those experiencing homelessness, overhaul our zoning ordinances and
        land-use guidelines, and fight to significantly increase the amount of
        money we allocate to the Affordable Housing Fund.
