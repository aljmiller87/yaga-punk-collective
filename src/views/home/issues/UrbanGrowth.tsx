        I opposed the urban service boundary expansion and were I on Council at
        the time, I would have voted against it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I am fully committed to implementing the expansion in as
        thoughtful, intentional, and equitable a way as possible. That means
        increasing our stock of affordable housing, prioritizing road safety,
        preventing the growth of urban sprawl, and ensuring we donâ€™t repeat the
        mistakes of the 1996 expansion.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, we must prioritize infill and redevelopment projects,
        assess the status of the thousands of acres of undeveloped and
        underutilized land within the urban service boundary, and create a
        pathway for truly sustainable growth.
