        I opposed the urban service boundary expansion. However, I am fully
        committed to implementing it in an equitable way that increases our
        stock of affordable housing, avoids increasing traffic, prioritizes road
        safety, and doesn&apos;t waste our tax dollars.{" "}

        At the same time, we must prioritize infill and redevelopment projects,
        prevent urban sprawl, and create a pathway for truly sustainable growth.
