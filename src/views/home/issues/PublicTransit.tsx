        LexTran needs to be fast, reliable, and affordable. Currently, it&apos;s
        slow, inconsistent, and expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will work to increase bus frequency, add routes, and invest wisely to
        ensure that LexTran gets everyone where they need to go at a reasonable
        pace. Doing so will not only increase access to transportationâ€”it will
        improve air quality, reduce traffic, and make our roads safer.
