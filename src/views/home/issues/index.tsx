        element of politicsâ€”pitting neighbor against neighbor, us vs. them.

        That's why I'm focused on the day-to-day, boots-on-the-ground issues
        that bring us together, not the divisive culture war policies that would
        rip our community apart.

        <b>move Lexington forward together.</b>
