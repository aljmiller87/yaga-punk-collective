        District 4 spans from Nicholasville Road to Tates Creek Road—and like
        most in our community, I&apos;ve spent far too much time sitting in
        standstill traffic on both of these roads.
      </p>
      <p>
        But these roads aren&apos;t just inconvenient and
        inaccessible—-they&apos;re dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, Kentucky State Police data showed that we saw a 566% increase
        in pedestrian fatalities from car crashes in Lexington over what we saw
        in 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with my colleagues, community partners, and constituents, I will
        work towards innovative solutions that incorporate modern technology and
        infrastructure to improve traffic flows, cut our travel time, and make
        our roads safe for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.
