      <p>
        With long shifts, dangerous working conditions, and low pay, it&apos;s
        no wonder our police remain short-staffed. To allow police to focus on
        major crimes, we should invest in programs that reduce homelessness,
        combat addiction, and deprioritize the enforcement of marijuana laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also believe that our tax dollars are best spent on public safety
        programs that bring our communities together, not on ones that are
        focused on increasing incarceration.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&apos;s why I will fight to expand our Community Paramedicine
        Program and advocate for hiring additional mental health professionals
        and social workers to assist in cases of non-violent crime.
