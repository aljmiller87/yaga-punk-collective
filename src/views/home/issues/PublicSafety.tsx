      <p>
        With long shifts, dangerous working conditions, and low pay, it&apos;s
        no wonder our police remain short-staffed. To allow police to focus on
        major crimes, we should invest in programs that reduce homelessness,
        combat addiction, and deprioritize the enforcement of marijuana laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also believe that our tax dollars are best spent on public safety
        programs that bring our communities together, not on ones that are
        focused on increasing incarceration. That&apos;s why I will introduce
        and fight for legislation to expand the number of Neighborhood Resource
        Officer districts from 3 to 12—one for each council district—to allow
        for more effective and direct community policing.
