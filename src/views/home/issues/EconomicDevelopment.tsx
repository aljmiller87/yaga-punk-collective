      <p>
        I support local businesses and entrepreneurs. Lexington has become the
        economic engine of central Kentucky because we have attracted large
        employers and great jobs. I will work to add jobs at competitive wages,
        and oppose handouts to corporations that don&apos;t benefit our
        communities.
