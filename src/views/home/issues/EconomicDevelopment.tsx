      <p>
        I support local businesses and entrepreneurs. Lexington has become the
        economic engine of central Kentucky because we have attracted large
        employers and great jobs. I will work to add jobs at competitive wages
        and oppose handouts to corporations that don’t benefit our communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The investments I’m proposing in infrastructure to make Nicholasville
        Road safer for all who use it, improve our water quality and waste
        management systems, and make the 4th District more walkable and bikeable
        won’t just improve our quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>They will bring new, good-paying jobs to South Lexington as well.</p>
