      <h2>Meet Emma</h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a lifelong Kentuckian. I was born in Lexington and have spent
        my entire adult life here.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a young, working class person, I know what it&apos;s like to watch my
        tax dollars go towards policies that actively make it harder for folks
        like me to thrive instead of going towards investments in our community
        that benefit all of us.
      </p>
      <p>This city is my home. Its future is my future.</p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m tired of the politics of anger and division putting that future
        at risk. That&apos;s why I&apos;m running to be your next District 4
        Councilmember.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that when we bring people together, we lead with empathy and
        compassion, and we commit ourselves to building a better, brighter, more
        sustainable future for the next generationâ€”there&apos;s nothing we
        can&apos;t accomplish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our district deserves a Councilmember with the drive to show up, stand
        for working families, and move Lexington forward together.
      </p>
