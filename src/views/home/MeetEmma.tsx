      <h2>Meet Emma</h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a lifelong Kentuckian. I was born here in Lexington and have
        spent my entire adult life here. Growing up on my family&apos;s tobacco
        farm, I learned quickly how to work hard and get the job done.
      </p>
      <p>I&apos;ve carried that work ethic with me ever since. </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I work as an independent filmmaker telling the stories of the
        remarkable people who make this city so special. I am also a community
        organizer advocating for policy changes at the state and local levels to
        ensure the safety, health, and dignity of all Lexingtonians.
      </p>
      <p>This city is my home. Its future is my future.</p>
      <p>
        As a young, working class person, I know what it&apos;s like to watch my
        tax dollars go towards policies that actively make it harder for folks
        like me to thrive instead of going towards investments in our community
        that benefit all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        As somebody who&apos;s deeply passionate about community-building and
        civic engagement, I know just how important it is to have accessible and
        responsive elected officials—especially at the local level.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this campaign isn&apos;t about me&mdash;it&apos;s about <b>us.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        That&apos;s why I am focused on the day-to-day, boots-on-the-ground
        issues that bring us together, not the divisive culture war policies
        that would rip our community apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that when we bring people together, we lead with empathy and
        compassion, and we commit ourselves to building a better, brighter, more
        sustainable future for the next generation—-there is nothing we
        can&apos;t accomplish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our district deserves a Councilmember with the drive to show up, stand
        for working families, and move Lexington forward together.{" "}
