  This one’s held together with more tape than staples and reeks faintly of
  basement mildew. Inside, we interview Rot Gut Dreams right after their
  guitarist quit mid-set to join a noise collective in Ohio. There’s a full-page
  spread of show flyers we found glued to a telephone pole (still with bits of
  the pole stuck to them), plus a rant about why streaming services are
  basically the devil disguised in app form. We’ve also included a recipe for
  “tour soup” (ingredients: gas station coffee, two packets of mustard, and a
  questionable hot dog) and a centerfold collage of feedback waveforms that
  looks like someone sneezed on the copier. It’s messy, loud, and probably the
  only zine that could give you tetanus just by flipping through it.
