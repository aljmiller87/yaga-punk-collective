bio: >
  Jared Foreman is a DIY punk author and cultural critic known for his raw,
  unfiltered takes on underground music, art, and resistance. Growing up in the
  squats and basement venues of the Midwest punk scene, Foreman developed a
  fierce commitment to the do-it-yourself ethos that defines his writing. His
  work captures the tension between chaos and community—how the same noise that
  rattles walls can also hold people together. Whether documenting late-night
  zine sessions or the politics of punk ethics, Foreman’s voice is both
  rebellious and deeply human.


  His breakout book, Down the Punk Rock Highway, weaves personal memoir with
  oral history, chronicling decades of shows, protests, and friendships forged
  through distortion and dissent. Rather than glorify the past, Foreman uses it
  as a mirror—examining what DIY means in an age of algorithms and burnout. His
  writing resonates with punks old and new, offering both a critique of
  commercialization and a love letter to the stubborn persistence of underground
  culture.


  Outside of his books, Foreman remains an active participant in the scene. He
  tours community spaces instead of corporate venues, donates proceeds to mutual
  aid projects, and mentors younger zinesters and bands trying to find their
  footing. True to his DIY roots, he still prints his own patches and writes
  most of his essays on a clunky thrift-store typewriter. For Foreman, punk
  isn’t a phase or aesthetic—it’s a lifelong practice of defiance, creation, and
  care.
