  title: Down The Punk Rock Highway
  description: >
    Evoking and channelling the spirit of rebellion, energy and freedom that
    defines the punk rock movement, Down The Punk Rock Highway is a testament to
    the determination of the writers' mission to detail and capture the scene,
    people and places that made punk rock what it was, is and can be over
    thirty-five years.


    Whether you're feeling nostalgic for the glory days of the eighties scene
    and want to revisit it, or just dipping your toes in the punk ocean for the
    first time and want to find out what it's all about, you'll find what you're
    looking for as you venture down the punk rock highway. Music, history and
    everything in between can be found in these pages. So wave your family and
    friends goodbye, throw your cases in the trunk, and start your engine. It's
    time to head down the Punk Rock Highway...


    Featuring interviews with members of Toxic Reasons, Doom, Happy Spastics,
    Adolescents, M.D C, The Avengers, Reagan Youth, Subhumans, Channel 3, Social
    Unrest, The Hated, A P.P.LE., The Maggots, Mission of Burma,
    Anti-Nowhere-League, The Detonators, Distraught, False Prophets and Icons of
    Filth, Jim Testa of Jersey Beat fame, the History of Danger House Records,
    the stories of ABC No Rio and Gilman Street and personal accounts and
    memories, from scene veterans and activists, Jared Forman's book is a punk
    completists dream.

  review:
    quote: >-
      Forman emphasizes the movement's role as a catalyst for social change and
      its ability to challenge norms and inspire action. Through stories of
      activism and resistance, he highlights impact beyond music, showcasing its
      influence on art, politics, and culture. Through these interviews,
      Forman's exploration of punk rock's broader significance underscores the
      power to provoke thought and inspire individuals to question the status
      quo.

  title: Yage Punk Collective Zine
  subtitle: >-
    Yage Punk Collective Zine is a raw, no-frills dispatch from the
    underground—part manifesto, part scrapbook, part megaphone for anyone sick
    of waiting for permission. Born out of basement shows, busted gear, and
    late-night rants scribbled on torn flyers, this zine isn’t about polish or
    profit—it’s about capturing the pulse of DIY punk as it thrashes in real
    time. Expect interviews with bands that barely exist, art that looks like it
    was photocopied five times too many, and words that hit like a sucker punch.
    If it feels messy, chaotic, and a little unhinged, good—that’s exactly the
    point.
