  description: >
    Evoking and channelling the spirit of rebellion, energy and freedom that
    defines the punk rock movement, Down The Punk Rock Highway is a testament to
    the determination of the writers' mission to detail and capture the scene,
    people and places that made punk rock what it was, is and can be over
    thirty-five years.


    Whether you're feeling nostalgic for the glory days of the eighties scene
    and want to revisit it, or just dipping your toes in the punk ocean for the
    first time and want to find out what it's all about, you'll find what you're
    looking for as you venture down the punk rock highway. Music, history and
    everything in between can be found in these pages. So wave your family and
    friends goodbye, throw your cases in the trunk, and start your engine. It's
    time to head down the Punk Rock Highway...


    Featuring interviews with members of Toxic Reasons, Doom, Happy Spastics,
    Adolescents, M.D C, The Avengers, Reagan Youth, Subhumans, Channel 3, Social
    Unrest, The Hated, A P.P.LE., The Maggots, Mission of Burma,
    Anti-Nowhere-League, The Detonators, Distraught, False Prophets and Icons of
    Filth, Jim Testa of Jersey Beat fame, the History of Danger House Records,
    the stories of ABC No Rio and Gilman Street and personal accounts and
    memories, from scene veterans and activists, Jared Forman's book is a punk
    completists dream.
