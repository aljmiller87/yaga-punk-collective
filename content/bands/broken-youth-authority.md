  Broken Youth Authority formed in a crumbling Midwestern town where the only thing louder than the freight trains was the boredom. The four-piece cut their teeth playing abandoned basements and parking lots, channeling the frustration of dead-end jobs, closed-down schools, and the looming threat of "growing up." Their music is fast, jagged, and unpolished—like if Black Flag and FIDLAR got in a fistfight behind a liquor store.

  Refusing to "clean up" for the industry, they self-record everything on secondhand tape decks and design their own gritty zines to hand out at shows. For them, punk isn't just music—it's survival. Their fanbase is a revolving door of disillusioned kids who finally hear someone screaming the words they've been choking on.
