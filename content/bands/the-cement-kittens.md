  Formed in the crumbling backrooms of a condemned bowling alley in Akron, Ohio, The Cement Kittens are what happens when sarcasm, rage, and three chords collide. Known for their chaotic live sets, impromptu soapbox rants, and questionable gear setups, they've built a cult following that thrives on duct tape aesthetics and broken strings.

  With influences ranging from Crass to Bikini Kill, the Kittens spit out anthems about late-stage capitalism, pet adoption, and alienation in small-town America. Their debut EP "Litter Box Politics" was recorded in a single take on a borrowed Tascam and distributed entirely on spray-painted CD-Rs.
