  The Shattered Mirrors started as a joke between two art-school dropouts but quickly evolved into one of the most unhinged bands on the underground circuit. They lean heavy into theatrics—spray-painted clothes, broken makeup mirrors smashed on stage, and cardboard props that fall apart mid-song. Their music is sharp, sarcastic, and chaotic, bouncing between hardcore breakdowns and bratty singalongs.

  Instead of pushing away mainstream pop, they cannibalize it—turning bubblegum choruses into screeching anthems. Every performance feels like a dare, like they're taunting the audience to take punk less seriously while taking it more seriously at the same time.
