title: Zine Releases
summary: |
  Born in 2025 from the global underground, Yage Magazine emerges as the uncompromising voice of punk's past, present, and future. Published by the Yage Punk Collective—a several-thousand-strong international community—this newsprint zine carries the torch of DIY journalism with the same unflinching honesty that defined Bukowski's literary underground.

  Editor and publisher Jared Forman, author of Down The Punk Rock Highway, brings decades of scene credibility to each 40-page issue. Like the best literary magazines of the 60s and 70s that gave voice to outsider writers, Yage bridges generations of punk rebellion, featuring conversations with veterans like New Model Army, Nausea, and MDC alongside fresh blood from the underground—bands like Reality Asylum, Violent Coercion, and Bev Rage.

  Printed on authentic newsprint with color covers and black-and-white interiors, each issue captures that tactile, immediate energy that can't be digitized or sanitized. With a modest 3,000-copy print run and a street price of $4-6, Yage remains accessible to the people it serves—distributed through indie shops, underground networks, and the same grassroots channels that built punk culture.

  This isn't music journalism; it's cultural archaeology. Each interview, each page carries that wild punk beat that connects the dots between rebellion and authenticity, between the scene's gritty origins and its uncompromising future. In an age of corporate music media, Yage Magazine stands as proof that the underground still has stories to tell—and the courage to tell them without apology.
