Rebel Rabbit is a 37 year old transgender woman who has loved punk rock since she was 16. It all started when she was building WW2 airplane models in her parents unfinished basement - trust me she was really cool in high school - and put on Pennywise's Full Circle for the first time. Rebel Rabbit was blown away and never turned back.

Rebel Rabbit was always political. In college, she worked with various drug reform policy groups and helped organize "Know Your Rights" training. She was also involved in political groups ranging from "Students for Liberty" to "Students for a Democratic Society."

After college, life slowed down for Rebel Rabbit as she got married and had kids. She was still social and even cofounded (a now defunct) Alliance of the Libertarian Left chapter in Austin, TX. After Rebel Rabbit came out, she got heavily involved in LGBT non profit volunteering at community centers and donating web work (what she does professionally).
