Phil is a 28 year old High School Music Teacher based out of High Point, North Carolina. He is a band director by day and a punk rocker by night. His primary instrument is the tuba, but bass is his secondary. He started playing bass in high school when he joined the Jazz Band. He got into bass because he enjoyed jazz and thought it might be fun. He quickly learned he loved being in the rhythm section and holding down the low end.

Phil's music tastes vary but there has always been a special place in his heart for metal/punk. "There is something special about the community that forms from the outcasts. We are no longer outcasts when we are together - we are all the same and that makes us feel loved and seen." Visibility is key in this world and that is something that matters to Phil a lot. His teaching philosophy is, "As long as you are having fun and trying - I don't care how amazing you are. Music heals the soul and if you are healing - that's good enough for me!"

Phil enjoys the punk scene a lot because of the amazing community that exists. Though he is newer to the scene - he is continuing to learn every day. "I'm here to fight the power and be a voice for those oppressed. I want people to hear us and hear our message and stand with us."

Phil is also an out and proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community. He is pansexual and proud of who he is. "It took a long time to accept who I was - fighting those battles regularly still - but I will continue to be me, everyday." Phil loves the community and wants to help make the world a better place through music.

"Fight the power and be a good human being!"
