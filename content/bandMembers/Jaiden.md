I've been in the music world since I was 12 — choir kid turned chaotic punk vocalist. Singing started as a survival tactic, a way to drown out the noise when I got thrown into the foster care system. It wasn't about chasing a dream. It was about staying grounded when everything else was falling apart.

I grew up in Ohio and made the move to North Carolina at 18, looking for something—anything—that felt like mine. Music became that place. A kind of rebellion. A kind of home.

I never planned on making it my whole life. But like everything I do, I threw myself in with no map and no plan — joined a band, barely knowing what the hell I was doing. Now, I wouldn't trade it for anything. The late-night sessions, the messy breakdowns, the breakthroughs, the noise, the sweat, the laughter… all of it.

I've found family in this band. We're not perfect, but we're loud. We're honest. We're trying. And I can't wait to keep growing with these weirdos and see where we end up next.
