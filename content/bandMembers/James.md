James is a 42-year-old living his second life in the punk world. In high school and college James was the guitarist and singer for a couple of punk bands in Toronto. Two decades later he decided to play drums instead because he gets to sit down. James is a raging leftist who used to piss in the wind in Facebook political arguments but now prefers to make statements with LTC.
