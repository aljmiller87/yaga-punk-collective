I'm a 27 year old queer trans woman who's been alternative/emo/goth or whatever you wanna call it since I was 15 shopping at Hot Topic, hating organized religion, and screaming in friends' garages with them and a couple of other degenerates who liked loud music.

I've never actually did anything with a microphone though either on a stage or in a studio like setting until just within this past year! Been screaming, singing, and writing for years but only as a quiet hobby behind closed doors.

Now, jumping into to a band called Louder Transition Collective, I don't think there's really a more perfect band for my debut into the live music scene, they're loud, political, and full of passion and good people, I'm so honored to bring my little emo self to this band and make it just that much louder one scream at a time
