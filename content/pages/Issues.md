Like most folks in the 4th District, I'm tired of the team sports element of politics—pitting neighbor against neighbor, us vs. them.

That's why I'm focused on the day-to-day, boots-on-the-ground issues that bring us together, not the divisive culture war policies that would rip our community apart.

I believe this platform will help us get past the hatred, the division, and the mean-spiritedness that has plagued our politics and move Lexington forward together.
