  - header: Emma Curtis was born in Lexington in 1996.
    description: |
      Growing up on her family's farm, she learned quickly how to work hard and
      get the job done. She's carried that work ethic with her ever since.

      From an early age, her family instilled in her an understanding of the
      importance of civic engagement and public service.

      Her mother worked for former Governor Wallace Wilkinson. Her uncle worked
      for everybody from the Legislative Research Commission to former Governor
      Steve Beshear. This gave Emma a front row seat to the day-to-day work that
      goes into making effective public policy.

  - header: Emma became politically active in 2016.
    description: |
      She wanted to push back against the cruelty and mean-spiritedness she saw
      brewing in her community during that year's presidential election.

      As a student at Centre College, she helped organize and participated in
      several campaigns and events aimed at increasing administrative
      transparency, preventing sexual assault and harassment on campus, and
      promoting inclusion and equality for students of color and LGBTQ+
      students.

      She also began knocking doors and phone-banking for the political
      campaigns of candidates she believed in, as well as attending rallies,
      marches, and community organizing meetings.

      After graduating from Centre in 2018, Emma has spent her entire adult
      life       working and living in Lexington.

      "Currently, she works as an independent filmmaker telling the stories of
      the remarkable people that make Lexington so special. Her most recent
      film,\_There Is No Answer: A Film About George Szekely, will be airing on
      KET this year.\n"

  - header: She also works as an issue-based organizer and advocate
    description: |
      Whether registering Lexingtonians to vote through her work as a voter
      engagement organizer at Kentuckians for the Commonwealth or volunteering
      with organizations like the ACLU of Kentucky and the Fairness Campaign,
      Emma has demonstrated a relentless commitment to building a better future
      for her community and her commonwealth.

  - header: '''Outside of work, she is extremely active in her community.'''
    description: |
      She is a member of several community-focused organizations, including
      CivicLex, the Lexington Branch of the Kentucky Women's Network, and the
      Lexington Forum, which are focused on bringing people together, having
      good-faith conversations, and improving Lexington's civic health.

      When she's not working, Emma enjoys spending quality time with her partner
      and family, going to see classic movies at The Kentucky Theatre, playing
      music with her friends, and taking her dog Benny for long walks at
      Veterans Park.

      Emma is running for Council because she loves her neighbors and community
      in South Lexington.
    description: |
      She knows that running for office is serious business. It's not something
      to do because you want a job that you can keep regardless of how often you
      miss work. It's not something to do because you're retired, wealthy, and
      want to put another feather in your cap.

      It's something to do because you care deeply about the people and
      communities you wish to serve.

      A Councilmember's job is to advocate for the people who live in their
      district and address the issues that matter to themâ€”and that's exactly
      what Emma will do.

      With your support, Emma Curtis will continue her record of choosing people
      over politics, community over division, and tangible good over empty
      gestures as the next Councilmember for District 4.
