  - header: Emma Curtis was born in Lexington in 1996.
    description: |
      Growing up on her family's farm, she learned quickly how to work hard and
      get the job done. She's carried that work ethic with her ever since.

      From an early age, her family instilled in her an understanding of the
      importance of civic engagement and public service.

      Her mother worked for former Governor Wallace Wilkinson. Her uncle worked
      for everybody from the Legislative Research Commission to former Governor
      Steve Beshear. This gave Emma a front row seat to the day-to-day work that
      goes into making effective public policy.

  - header: Emma became politically active in 2016.
    description: |
      She wanted to push back against the cruelty and mean-spiritedness she saw
      brewing in her community during that year's presidential election.

      As a student at Centre College, she helped organize and participated in
      several campaigns and events aimed at increasing administrative
      transparency, preventing sexual assault and harassment on campus, and
      promoting inclusion and equality for students of color and LGBTQ+
      students.

      She also began knocking doors and phone-banking for the political
      campaigns of candidates she believed in, as well as attending rallies,
      marches, and community organizing meetings.
