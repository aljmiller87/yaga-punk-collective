    description: |
      Growing up on her family's farm, she learned quickly how to work hard and
      get the job done. She's carried that work ethic with her ever since.

      From an early age, her family instilled in her an understanding of the
      importance of civic engagement and public service.

      Her mother worked for former Governor Wallace Wilkinson. Her uncle worked
      for everybody from the Legislative Research Commission to former Governor
      Steve Beshear. This gave Emma a front row seat to the day-to-day work that
      goes into making effective public policy.
