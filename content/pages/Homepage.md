## I'm a lifelong Kentuckian.

I was born in Lexington and have spent my entire adult life here.

As a young, working class person, I know what it's like to watch my tax dollars go towards policies that actively make it harder for folks like me to thrive instead of going towards investments in our community that benefit all of us.

This city is my home. Its future is my future.

I'm tired of the politics of anger and division putting that future at risk. That's why I'm running to be your next District 4 Councilmember.

I believe that when we bring people together, we lead with empathy and compassion, and we commit ourselves to building a better, brighter, more sustainable future for the next generationâ€”there's nothing we can't accomplish.

Our district deserves a Councilmember with the drive to show up, stand for working families, and move Lexington forward together.

## Let's elect one who will.
