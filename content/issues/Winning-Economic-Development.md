I support local businesses and entrepreneurs. Lexington has become the economic engine of central Kentucky because we have attracted large employers and great jobs. I will work to add jobs at competitive wages and oppose handouts to corporations that don’t benefit our communities.

The investments I’m proposing in infrastructure to make Nicholasville Road safer for all who use it, improve our water quality and waste management systems, and make the 4th District more walkable and bikeable won’t just improve our quality of life.

They will bring new, good-paying jobs to South Lexington as well.
