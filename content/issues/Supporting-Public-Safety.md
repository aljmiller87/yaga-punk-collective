With long shifts, dangerous working conditions, and low pay, it's no wonder our police remain short-staffed. To allow police to focus on major crimes, we should invest in programs that reduce homelessness, combat addiction, and deprioritize the enforcement of marijuana laws.

I also believe that our tax dollars are best spent on public safety programs that bring our communities together, not on ones that are focused on increasing incarceration.

That's why I will fight to expand our Community Paramedicine Program and advocate for hiring additional mental health professionals and social workers to assist in cases of non-violent crime.
