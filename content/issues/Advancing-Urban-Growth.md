I opposed the urban service boundary expansion and were I on Council at the time, I would have voted against it.


However, I am fully committed to implementing the expansion in as thoughtful, intentional, and equitable a way as possible. That means increasing our stock of affordable housing, prioritizing road safety, preventing the growth of urban sprawl, and ensuring we donâ€™t repeat the mistakes of the 1996 expansion.


At the same time, we must prioritize infill and redevelopment projects, assess the status of the thousands of acres of undeveloped and underutilized land within the urban service boundary, reduce the pressure on homeowners, and create a pathway for truly sustainable growth.
