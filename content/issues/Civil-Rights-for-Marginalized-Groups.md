In Frankfort, our State Legislature has chosen to waste time and taxpayer money attacking the civil rights of marginalized communities.


In Lexington, we have proudly stood for the rights of all people. We must continue to protect our Fairness Ordinance and support people of color, women, LGBTQ people, and everybody whose freedoms are at risk.


Hate has no home here.
