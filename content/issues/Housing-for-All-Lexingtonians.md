Renters and homeowners alike deserve homes they can thrive in at prices they can afford.

That's why I fought hard to ensure our Council passed a ban on source-of-income discrimination and why I will always advocate for policies that prioritize Lexingtonians, not predatory out-of-state corporations or special-interest groups.

As your councilmember, I will push to create more emergency housing for those experiencing homelessness, overhaul our zoning ordinances and land-use guidelines, and fight to significantly increase the amount of money we allocate to the Affordable Housing Fund.
