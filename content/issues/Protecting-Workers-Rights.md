Lexington was, and continues to be, built by union workers. I will always have their backs.

Whether it's advocating for Project Labor Agreements, fighting to ensure South Lexington wins economic development projects that will ensure our middle class can thrive, or working with our union teachers and school board to ensure that they have the resources they need to give our kids a world-class education—I will always stand with working people fighting for a fair shake.
