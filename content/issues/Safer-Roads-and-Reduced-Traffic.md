District 4 spans from Nicholasville Road to Tates Creek Road—and like most in our community, I've spent far too much time sitting in standstill traffic on both of these roads.

But these roads aren't just inconvenient and inaccessible—they're dangerous.

In 2023, Kentucky State Police data showed that we saw [a 566% increase in pedestrian fatalities from car crashes in Lexington over what we saw in 2022](https://www.kentucky.com/news/local/counties/fayette-county/article283593513.html).

Along with my colleagues, community partners, and constituents, I will work towards innovative solutions that incorporate modern technology and infrastructure to improve traffic flows, cut our travel time, and make our roads safe for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.
