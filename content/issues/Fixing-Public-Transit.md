LexTran needs to be fast, reliable, and affordable. Currently, it's slow, inconsistent, and expensive.

I will work to increase bus frequency, add routes, and invest wisely to ensure that LexTran gets everyone where they need to go at a reasonable pace. Doing so will not only increase access to transportationâ€”it will improve air quality, reduce traffic, and make our roads safer.
