title: About Yage Punk Collective Label
summary: >
  Born from basement shows, busted amps, and a deep love for raw sound, our DIY
  punk rock label exists to amplify the voices that refuse to be polished. We're
  not here for industry trends or algorithmic hitsâ€”we're here for the sweat, the
  noise, and the spirit that fuels underground scenes across the globe. Whether
  it's cassette tapes dubbed in a garage or zines stapled at 3 a.m., we believe
  in doing it ourselves and doing it loud.


  We're a collective of misfits, musicians, and zinesters pushing back against
  the sanitized and the safe. Our label is a home for artists who value
  authenticity over perfection, who'd rather play to five real fans than chase a
  million fake streams. If you've got something to say and the guts to scream
  it, we've got your back.
